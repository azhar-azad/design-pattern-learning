Chapter 01: Intro to design patterns: Welcome to design patterns [Strategy Pattern]
    # Separate what changes from what stays the same.
        - We know that fly() and quack() are the parts of the Duck class that vary across ducks. To separate these
        behaviors from the Duck class, we'll pull both methods out of the Duck class and create a new set of classes to
        represent each behavior.

    # Program to interface.
        - The Duck behaviors will live in a separate class - a class that implements a particular behavior interface.
        - That way, the Duck classes(super & sub) won't need to know any of the implementation details for their own behaviors.
        - “Program to an interface” really means “Program to a supertype.” You can program to an interface without
        having to actually use a Java interface.
        - We could rephrase "program to a supertype" as "the declared type of the variables should be a supertype,
        usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects assigned to those variables can be of any concrete
        implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesn't have to know about the actual
        object types!"

    # Use composition over inheritance.
        - When you put two classes together like our example, you're using composition. Instead of inheriting their behavior,
        the ducks get their behavior by being composed with the right behavior object.

    # The Strategy Pattern.
        - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
        - Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

    # Bullet Points
        - Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good designer.
        - Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.
        - Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
        - Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.
        - Patterns don't give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application.
        - Patterns aren't invented, they are discovered.
        - Most patterns and principle address issues of change in software.
        - Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.
        - We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
        - Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.


Chapter 02: The Observer Pattern: Keeping your Objects in the Know [Observer Pattern]
    # The Observer Pattern.
        - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its
        dependents are notified and updated automatically.
        - A newspaper subscription, with its publishers and subscribers, is a good way to visualize the pattern.

    # Observer pattern vs Publish-Subscribe pattern.
        - Although they are related, Publish-Subscribe pattern is a more complex pattern that allows subscribers to
        express interest in different types of messages and further separates publishers from subscribers. It is
        often used in middleware systems.
