The Factory Pattern: Baking with OO Goodness [Factory Pattern]
    # What's wrong with "new"?
        - It's a fundamental part of most modern object-oriented languages and technically there's nothing wrong with
        the "new" operator. The real culprit is "CHANGE" and how change impacts our use of new.
        - If your code is written to an interface, then it will work with any new classes implementing that interface
        through polymorphism.
        - However, when you have code that makes use of lots of concrete classes, you're looking for trouble because
        that code may have to be changed as new concrete classes are added.
        - So, in other words, your code will not be "closed to modification". To extend your code with new concrete
        types, you'll have to reopen it.
