### About the example
The example is to show the Chain of responsibility pattern that can be used in real world like an 
**ATM Dispense Machine**. The user enters the amount to be dispensed and the machine dispense amount 
in terms of defined currency bills such as 1000TK, 500TK, 200TK, 100TK etc. 
If the user enters an amount that is not multiples of 100, it throws error. 
Here, the chain of responsibility pattern is used to implement this solution.
